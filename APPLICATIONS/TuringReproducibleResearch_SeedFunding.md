# Seed Funding Application

## Research description

### Description and alignment with strategic aims
*(1000 words)*

Basically, what we want to do is make sure that all the work done in the Turing Institute is reproducible. What does that mean? Well, it means that when you say you've done a piece of research and you write up your results, someone else can actually check your working! They can run the exact same code as you on the exact same input data and get the same result.

Seems bonkers that that doesn't exist, right? But it really isn't well adopted.

HOWEVER the tide is changing. Journals are starting to require data be made available on submission (eg: Nature Human Behaviour) and reviewers who sign the PRO are refusing to assess manuscripts that do not make their data and analysis steps available.

We have a bunch of smart people here at the Turing and we want to make sure the can all benefit from the collective outputs. Eg: if someone publishes some code to do a cool analysis, other members of the Turing should immediately be able to access that code and data.

***Accessible Data Sets***

Not mandatory, but if a researcher who has spent a lot of time using some data wants to make it available to others in the Institute we will provide documentation and dissemination channels.

Data sets can either be made openly available to all, in which case the access by Turing researchers will be the same as access by members of the public. Specifically, when a research paper is published a Scientific Data paper will also accompany the publication along with a database of clean data.

If the data is sensitive, or the researcher would prefer not to share it openly, then the Turing Institute Reproducible Research liaison officer can host it within the Turing under different levels of password control (eg: open to all Turing members, open to Turing members on a specific collaboration list, open to members given a data access agreement).

Importantly, the documentation will be standardised and easy to follow. If we do this from the beginning of projects, it won't be hard to do!

***Open Source Code***

In order to know exactly what someone did with their data to get the results they have published in a paper, then we need their analysis steps.

There are a few basic ways to share what you did to your data: protocols.io is the most simple: a recipe book that can be shared and updated by other researchers as they perform the same experiments. Stepping up a level is to provide the analysis code that a researcher used. Often, however, this is difficult to manage because there are many dependencies that must be installed before code can be run. This is where the Research Software Engineers come in. They have the expertise to clean up and generalise research analysis code to ensure that others can install and run it without any problems.

***Training***

By design, the Turing Institute comprises researchers of different backgrounds and expertise. An often cited reason for not ensuring that research is reproducible is the lack of training provided in the tools. We will run brief trainings and provide getting-started resources for version control with git and GitHub, code testing, intro to coding in Python, R and Unix, along with "demystify" sessions around software engineering. We will ensure that all members of the turing have good onboarding documentation and will provide office hours to trouble shoot anyone getting started.

***Communication***

Maintaining a database of code and data requires a balance of scientific literacy, probably gained during a PhD in a computational field, and excellent communication skills. It takes effort and time to survey the current researchers and pull together work they have already completed or are in the process of doing. We will keep all members of the Turing up to date with resources that are available to them. We will also share and promote tools and datasets that are available to the general data science community.

***Requirement Gathering***

The most important step in our plan is to see what already exists, what needs to be curated and if there are already tools that would do the job. A reproducible research plan doesn't work if people don't use it! We will focus on collecting information around:

* What tools already exist?
* What are researchers in the Turing Institute using?
* Can we contribute to existing projects to make them even better?
* Do we need to create any new software?

***Version Control***

Version control is when you actually pay attention to what you're doing and keep track of all the changes you made! It's really easy to do for code on GitHub. We want to ensure that everyone in the Turing is keeping track of their work so they can always roll back and recreate any project they need at any time.

You can do version control for data too eg via: https://datproject.org/. We want to include this and make it super easy for researchers within the Turing to share their data.

Version control lets many people work on a project at the same time.

You can also roll back in time to a particular version of the code so you can recreate exactly what you did.

We want to provide three pathways for reproducible research to Turing members:

1. **Open from the start**: All work is conducted in a public GitHub repository from the beginning meaning that anyone can follow the project and potentially contribute.
2. **Private then public**: The work is conducted in a private GitHub repository that is switched to public on publication of a related paper. All versions of the code are therefore made available but the development is kept within the Turing Institute.
3. **Private then clean public repository**: The work is developed in a private GitHub repository and on publication a new "clean" public repository is created and shared. All code is available but the (sometimes messy) history of the project stays private.

***Turing Strategic Aims***

This proposal aligns with the **Systems and Platforms** focus of the Turing Institute. We will provide support, training and guidance to ensure that all members of the Turing are able, *with ease*, to share their work and allow others to quickly verify their work.

This Reproducible Research proposal benefits every one of the six priority sectors for the Turing Institute. Awareness of the "reproducibility crisis" is very high in the biomedical sciences and social sciences, but providing supporting evidence for our work is necessary in all fields of Data Science.

We will work with all members of the Turing Institute to ensure they meet industry standard levels of ethical approval with respect to their sharing data. For example, we will provide guidance on how to share potentially identifiable data from human subjects, or to maintain the privacy of proprietary code.

Everyone benefits when we can trust academic research.


### Outputs and Impact

*(250 words)*

The Reproducible Research at the Turing seed funding will provide the following outputs:

1. Documentation, research software engineer support and expert guidance to ensure any member of the Turing Institute who would like to make their work reproducible is able to do so.
2. A curated database of resources within the Turing Institute including available data sets, open source code and training materials.
3. An onboarding program of resources and in person trainings to ensure all members of the Turing Institute are able to start work efficiently on their arrival.

The Reproducible Research seed funding will provide the following impact:

* Individual researchers at the Turing Institute will benefit immediately as they will be able to access resources quickly and receive support in disseminating their work.
* The partner universities will benefit as their associated publications will be reproducible, which is both faster and more efficient that "reinventing the wheel" each time, and allows submission to higher impact journals as TOP guidelines are adopted more widely.
* The Turing will benefit by a strengthening of their brand as being world leaders in data science. We will build a culture of reproducibility within the Institute which will ensure all readers will trust output from the Alan Turing Institute. They will also receive more citations from the data and software papers that accompany traditional academic articles.
* The wider data science community will benefit from the tools and open data sets provide by members of the Turing Institute. Furthermore, they will have concrete examples of how to ensure their own work is reproducible, improving the reliability of the field as a whole.


## Resources, Budget and Planning

### Justification
